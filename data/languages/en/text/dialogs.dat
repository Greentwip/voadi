glug glug glug
*hic*

Let me tell you my life
story.

My PhD is in mechanical
engineering from the
University of Galapagos.
Since I was a chick I've
wanted to fix the trash
that plagued the shore.
Day and night I created
a machine could turn trash
into usable materials.
Finally it was finished.
The beach was pristine and
people called me a hero.
I said "no, I'm just one
part of this. You all
are the heroes." *hic*
From then on, whenever I
was praised, they would
say,
"She was just one part
of it. It was a
collective effort." *hic*
Things went downhill. *hic*
They became increasingly
insecure and defensive.
A recycling committee was
formed solely to block
all of my contributions.
The trash piled up again.
I was stuck, but I wanted
to do the right thing.
One night I took my
machine to the beach and
I cleaned it alone.
Next morning, the committe
was furious. They called
me a liar and criminal.
In a drawn-out process,
I tried to defend myself,
but they doubled down.
So, I destroyed the
machine.

If they are the real
heroes, surely they can
make another one.
